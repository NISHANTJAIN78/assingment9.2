STORE 2 INTO '/pigoutput';

DUMP-
It is used to print the contents of a relation on the console.
Dump b ;

FOREACH-
It is used to  generate data transformations based on columns of data.
2 = FOREACH c GENERATE b1, b2, b2*b3;

FILTER-
It is used to remove unwanted rows from a relation.
f = FILTER c by $2 > 2;

GROUP BY- 
It is used to group the data in a single relation.
g = GROUP c by $1;

g = GROUP c by ($1,$2); 

h = GROUP c ALL;

ORDER BY- 
It is used to arrange a relation in a sorted order based on one or more fields (ascending or descending).
f = order c by b1 desc ;

 DESCRIBE-
